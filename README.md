The Label and Decal Management Application is a powerful software solution designed to streamline the process of managing and printing labels and decals within an organization. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and submitting label orders, along with role-based access control for different users within the organization.

With this application, users can upload PDF files containing label designs, easily edit the text on the labels, and submit orders for printing. The system allows for efficient collaboration between team members, ensuring smooth approval workflows and accurate printing of labels and decals.
